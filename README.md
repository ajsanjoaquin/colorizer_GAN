# colorizer_GAN w/ Lightning

This repository is primarily meant to showcase the features of Pytorch Lightning and how it can streamline three different training tasks. 
The training tasks in order are: </br>

1. Self-Supervized Training  of the Generator Backbone (Resnet 18) </br>
2. Supervized Training of the Generator </br>
3. GAN Training </br>

You can train your own GAN Colorizer, or use the given weights to colorize your own images. Most of the code are modified from [Moein's GAN Colorizer training](https://colab.research.google.com/github/moein-shariatnia/Deep-Learning/blob/main/Image%20Colorization%20Tutorial/Image%20Colorization%20with%20U-Net%20and%20GAN%20Tutorial.ipynb#scrollTo=S_b9HzPgYTpq) and [Ian's Implementation of Self-Supervized Learning](https://snappishproductions.com/blog/2020/05/25/image-self-supervised-training-with-pytorch-lightning.html.html).
